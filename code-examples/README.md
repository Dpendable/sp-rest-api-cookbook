The files in this directory are included in the main document via
org-mode `#INCLUDE:` directives.

All source examples should be committed here, and then described and
included in the document `sp-rest-api-tutorial.txt` so that when that
is rendered as a PDF or HTML or ebook or whatever, the code is
included and has been given some context.
