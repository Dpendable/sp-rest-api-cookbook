# Using the Arbor Networks SP REST API: SP v8.3 API v2

This repository contains the source material for a document that is
intended to be a gentle, user-facing introduction to the Arbor 
Networks SP REST API.

## Formatting

The file `sp-rest-api-tutorial.txt` is formatted according to
[Emacs Orgmode](http://orgmode.org/guide/) formatting rules.  You
don't need Emacs or Orgmode to edit this file; the examples in the
file should be sufficient guidance for adding to it and the link to
the [Orgmode Guide](http://orgmode.org/guide/) may also help.

## Contributing

All contributions are greatly appreciated; pull requests, emailed
patches, emailed edits, printed and written-on paper, whatever works
easiest for you.

## Rendering

If you want to render this you can use Emacs+Orgmode's Export (`C-e`)
command to produce HTML, PDF, etc.

## Releases

Rendered versions will be released periodically at this Github site;
unless you are intending to contribute or want to render your own
version, the rendered releases are probably the best option for you.
